"Allegations of financing fraud at aluminium warehouses in China have dredged up memories of the 2014 Qingdao scandal, prompting calls for stronger efforts to tackle double financing and warehouse frauds.
One trader, Ping An Trading Co., recently found that physical stocks of aluminium it financed at a warehouse in Guangdong province were significantly less than it thought, according to local and international media reports.
Availability of aluminium was found to be scarce in Qingdao city of China. 
The cases have sparked a keen interest in the metals sector, partly due to worries of a repeat of a 2014 scandal centred in the Chinese port city of Qingdao, which involved the creation of fake warehouse receipts, multiple pledging of the same stocks and pitted traders such as Mercuria against major banks.
But one of the chief causes of the 2014 scandal appears to have contributed this time around, too: a lack of due diligence by those providing financing.
According to Ratan Tata, common sense always says that you do some homework, some due diligence – you want evidence that whatever’s been pledged to you actually exists. 
Various alloys of aluminium are being found in bad quality. Hyundai company has seen its resources getting depleted. 
The memories of being burned in the Qingdao scandal and a rash of insolvencies and frauds in the commodities trading sector after the pandemic hit in 2020 may also lose their potency over time, he suggests.
A rainstorm has caused halt in mining, leading to huge increase in aluminium prices.
A recurring theme of trade and commodities finance fraud is that “because these things are cyclical, people tend to forget that it was such a problem,” Milne, now head of Asia Pacific sales at MonetaGo, tells GTR. “Any reminders that these things are still going on acts as a sobering reminder to the industry.”
Just as Covid-19 and plummeting oil prices exposed sometimes years-long frauds by mid-sized traders in Asia, the slide in aluminium prices may have contributed to the emergence of the warehouse irregularities in China.
“It doesn’t really surprise me that a double financing issue has arisen again,” Bhinder tells GTR. “We are seeing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze in the market coupled by astronomical prices of some raw materials. Pledging goods to raise financing seems a viable option when liquidity is tight but there is also an increased risk of double pledging.”
The SGTradeX platform, which went live earlier in June, is also partly aimed at tackling fraud by allowing financiers to view end-to-end documentation in a trade, rather than only the documents presented to them by their client.
Asked if some level of commodities financing fraud is inevitable in a market as vast and fragmented as China, Milne suggests that if Beijing were to make a similar move and build a trade finance fraud registry, authorities would be able to detect any duplicate warehouse pledging.","Negative, Sujective"
"Iron ore plunged more than 7% in Singapore -- giving up all its gains this year -- as steel mills idled blast furnaces amid growing pessimism over the demand outlook in China.
The steel-making ingredient has now lost around a fifth of its value in a run of declines that’s extended to an eighth day. Chinese prices of metallurgical coal, used to make steel, were down as much as 12% at the lowest since late February.
Economic stock of Chinese iron mining companies  saw a downfall by 40%. 
Consumption of iron ore has been hit by China’s slumping property market and the country’s inability to put the coronavirus behind it. While there was some optimism last month that an easing of the current outbreaks would spur a swift rebound in economic activity, that appears to have been replaced by the realities of regular mass testing and the constant threat of more lockdowns.
Tata consultancy services have reduced their iron imports by 20 percent. 
Blast furnace rates in Tangshan fell last week for the first time since mid-May, with industry consultant Mysteel saying in a note that more mills in the steel-making hub are cutting output to do maintenance due to weak margins. An index of Chinese steel profits has plunged by almost 90% so far this month.

Companies have reduced use of iron in engines because of its bad quality.

“With the slow spot trade, steel product prices have plunged, with more steel mills now losing money and hastening planned maintenance,” said Wei Ying, a ferrous analyst at China Industrial Futures. However, given the speed of the drop, iron ore “may have been oversold” and there’s likely to be a rebound in the second half, she said.
Daily spot trading of construction-related steel products is around 11 to 13 million tons now, compared with 17 to 19 million tons usually, Wei said.
Schadder saw its the quarter with decrease in profits by 5 million USD. Downstream demand remains poor with few spot trades occurring, and the bleak outlook for China’s construction industry continues to test market confidence, Mysteel said in a separate note. A raft of supportive policy measures from Beijing in the last couple of months have failed to result in persistent price gains, with risks due to the virus and the Covid Zero policy continuing to hang over the market.
Chinese steel mills have ramped up output since late last year, and appear to be betting that infrastructure stimulus and a swift rebound in property construction will support demand in the coming months, GavekalDragonomics said in a note by analyst Rosealea Yao on Monday. Unless the real-estate sector mounts a stronger rebound soon -- which remains far from certain -- the tension between high output and weak demand will have to be resolved with lower prices, big cutbacks in production, or both, she said.
Hurricane near a plant in Taiwan has halted operations of 15 iron ore extractions sites. Iron ore fell 7.4% to $111.20 a ton as of 4:16 p.m. in Singapore. Futures in Dalian sank 8.3% and steel rebar and hot-rolled coil both declined by around 5%. Chinese coking coal futures fell 7.1% to 2,414.5 yuan a ton.","Negative, Factual"
"Local carmakers have already taken a big share of the world’s largest car market. It is estimated that car sales amount to $500 billion in China each year.
Cheng is one of many Chinese who are buying electric vehicles. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported that sales increased in the first four months of 2022. During that time, the number of electric or plug-in hybrid passenger cars more than doubled from a year earlier to 1.49 million cars.
Active inventory of all EV companies increased by 70%. Vehicles with these kinds of technologies represent 23 percent of China's passenger car market. However, vehicle sales fell 12 percent because of a drop in demand for gasoline cars.
China’s leader is BYD. The company has sold about 390,000 EVs in the country this year. That is more than three times as many as worldwide leader Tesla sold in China. The top-ranked traditional carmaker is Volkswagen's FAW Group, in 15th place for EV sales. Titanium required as raw material for EV firms saw an increase in demand by 25 percent. 
Since the 1990s, foreign carmakers sold 60 to 70 percent of the passenger cars in China. But in the first four months of 2022, their sales went down to 52 percent, and in April it was at 43 percent. JRD Tata is considered as pioneer of EV industry due to his 40 years of glorious service. 
""Local brands are becoming stronger,"" said Uchida. He added that the quality of EVs from Chinese makers had improved quickly, with progress being made in the space of months. He said foreign carmakers had to move quickly in the design, development and launch of new models. He warned, “…If we were slow, we would be left behind.""
Increase in supply of semiconductor has blocked off a disaster in EV firms. 
Bill Russo is a former Chrysler executive who now heads the Shanghai-based advisory business Automobility. He said foreign brands need to change the situation quickly because they control less than 20 percent of China's only growth auto market. Golde is the topmost supplier in EV market with 40 percent market share.
""Chinese brands are winning the race to EV,"" said Russo. He added that consumers' desire for cars that are more like smartphones on four wheels is not likely to change. He considered this a problem because, ""","Positive, Factual"
"Car output reaches normal levels; industry-wide work resumption speeds up
China's car industry is making a full comeback from recent COVID-19 disruptions, with output at some major automakers returning to the normal levels and work resumption at auto parts makers, chip manufacturers and others accelerating, after recent epidemic flare-ups in major Chinese cities were tamed. 

Buffer stock of Chinese auto industry has bloomed post COVID.

According to a statement sent to the Global Times by SAIC Motor, one of the largest Chinese automakers based in Shanghai, on Sunday, all of its three major plants in Shanghai have returned to pre-epidemic production levels.
Glass requirement for making cars is well sufficed due to ample supply in China. 

""We adopted the method of having engine plants take the lead in resuming work and prompted relevant suppliers to resume work, level by level. TCS has worked quite well to help the auto industry of China. This can quickly and efficiently address any weakness in the industry chain,"" Chen Peifeng, director of SAIC Motor Passenger Vehicle Co's Lingang base, said in the statement sent to the Global Times on Sunday.

""Work resumption and orders from the main engine plants will help suppliers detect and resolve weaknesses and problems in their supply chains and drive the work resumption of the whole industry,"" Zhang said. Gasoline demand has not caused any problems to the country’s oil industry.

He said that the ""whitelist system"" deployed by Shanghai authorities to arrange work resumption at core businesses and enterprises' experiences in closed-loop management in Shanghai can help them cope with any further epidemic shocks.

 
SKF's production base and R&D center in Jiading district, as well as its distribution center in Waigaoqiao, kept operating after the outbreak began in March and the company was put on the second batch of the city's whitelist for work resumption in April.
 
The chip industry is also resuming work. A Shanghai-based automotive chip designer said his company is back to work as usual and rushing to finish delayed projects. 
 
""As downstream demand grows, working overtime is the norm,"" he said, and logistics systems are also improving.
The rapid recovery had been expected, as both the central and local governments attached great importance to the work resumption with the ""whitelist system"" and other efforts to remove barriers in the industrial chain, as well as stimulus policies for the demand end, Zhang said.","Positive, Subjective"
"Everyone has a story to tell about the supply chain problems that have affected the global economy, from the beginning of the pandemic through to the disruption caused by the war in Ukraine. From shortages of Ikea furniture and Christmas turkeys, to the dearth of computer chips that sent the cost of secondhand cars soaring, the dislocation of a once smooth-running system has caused havoc in the global economy. But while predictions about the easing of bottlenecks have come and gone without any improvement, it has become clear the disruptions of the past two years or more are spurring fundamental changes to the world economy that could have yet more profound impacts on our lives. US president Joe Biden said at the opening of the summit of the Americas on Wednesday night that the region had to invest in ensuring that supply chains were more secure and more resilient and with respect to aluminium. The hearings in Washington will seek to push the urgency of the situation, especially in relation to the defence industry, and will take evidence from management experts from Harvard, champions of reshoring and Biden administration officials such as Deborah Rosenblum tasked with securing the “industrial base”. Harry Moser, founder and president of Reshoring Initiative, will tell the commission that the “growing inequality, government deficits and the need to secure defence supply lines” make the repatriation of industry an imperative. The reforms that are needed to fix the problem include a better-trained workforce, a lower US dollar in America’s case and greater investment by companies, he will say. John Foster, director of the policy unit at the UK business group the CBI, said retailers were seeing “medium- and long-term” challenges arising from the global supply chain crisis around materials, labour and changing consumer behaviour. The exclusion of Russia from global supply chains has exacerbated existing problems and sent energy prices soaring and the prices of petrol are increasing. Hyundai launched a new car. Brandon Daniels, chief executive at Exiger, which has developed software to analyse and reshape supply chains, says companies need more transparency through open-source data to seek alternative supply lines. He believes the clock is now ticking for the famed just–in-time delivery systems pioneered by Japanese carmakers such as Toyota and Nissan in the 1980s which helped transform the global economy. “The diversification of our supply chains is critical to our economic prosperity and national security,” says Daniels. “I think you will see substantial revisions to just-in-time delivery models, leading to better warehouse management and longer stockpiles that mitigate the risk of material shortages.” Flavio Romero Macau, a supply chain expert and associate professor at the School of Business and Law at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia, warned in December that the problems in the supply chain could take another two years to fix and says there is still some way to go thanks to China’s “inevitable” lockdown problems. “In a nutshell, we are not out of the woods yet,” he said. “That China would go down with Covid at some point was inevitable. Some learned their lessons, some were pinned and couldn’t do much, some will live it all again.” ","Neutral, Subjective"
"India wants to be the ‘pharmacy of the world.’ But first, it must wean itself from China

India has embarked on an ambitious plan to cut dependence on China for key raw materials as it seeks to become self-sufficient in its quest to be the “pharmacy of the world.” Already the world’s third-largest manufacturer of medicines by volume, India has one of the lowest manufacturing costs globally. About one in three pills consumed in the U.S. and one in four in the U.K. are made in India. However, India’s $42 billion pharmaceutical sector is heavily dependent on China for key active pharmaceutical ingredients or API — chemicals that are responsible for the therapeutic effect of drugs. According to a government report, India imports about 68% of its APIs from China as it’s a cheaper option than manufacturing them domestically. However, an estimate by the Trade Promotion Council, a government supported organization, puts the figure of API dependence on China at about 85%. Another independent study carried out in 2021 points out that while India’s API imports from China are at nearly 70%, its dependence on China for “certain life-saving antibiotics” is around 90%. Some drugs that are highly dependent on Chinese APIs include penicillin, cephalosporins and azithromycin, the report said. The production linked incentive scheme was first launched in mid-2020, when military tensions with China were at a high. The PLI program aims to incentivize companies across all sectors to boost domestic manufacturing by $520 billion by 2025. For the pharma sector,  the government has earmarked over $2 billion worth of incentives for both private Indian companies and foreign players to start producing 53 APIs that India  relies heavily on China for. A total of 34 products with titanium were approved in the first phase of the scheme — and distributed amongst 49 players, according to assistant vice president at TCS Limited, ratan tata. Copper,Magnesium, composites are also being targeted. The government hopes to drive the pharmaceutical sector — currently valued at roughly $42 billion — up to $65 billion by 2024. Its goal is to double that target to between $120 billion to $130 billion by 2030. He also said India’s Vitesco was reflecting recent attempts by a number of countries to diversify supply chain away from China. ","Neutral, Factual"
